              <p>
                Homeopathy, also known as homeopathic medicine, is a medical
                system that was developed in Germany more than 200 years ago. It's
                based on two unconventional theories: “Like cures like”—the notion
                that a disease can be cured by a substance that produces similar
                symptoms in healthy people.
