                <!-- Ayurvedic medicine starts -->
                <h2>Ayurvedic Medicine:</h2>
                <p>Ayurveda is an ancient Indian healing system that focuses on balancing the mind, body, and spirit. Ayurvedic herbs are used for several reasons, including: </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>To "cleanse" the body</li>
                    <li>To defend against disease</li>
                    <li>To balance the mind, body, and spirit</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Ayurvedic medicine aims to prevent illness—rather than respond to disease—by maintaining a balance between your body, mind, and environment. </p>

                <h3>Types of Ayurvedic Herbs provided:</h3>
                <p>Ayurvedic treatments include more than 600 herbal formulas and 250 single plant remedies. Ayurveda categorizes therapies according to their health effects, such as pain relief or increased vitality (energy). </p>
                
                <h4>Triphala</h4>
                <p>Triphala is actually not one Ayurvedic herb, but a botanical formula that contains three different ones: </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Amla</li>
                    <li>Myrobalan</li>
                    <li>Belleric Myrobalan</li>
                </ul>
                <p> Test tube studies have suggested that triphala may have antioxidant effects. Antioxidants are nutrients that naturally occur in some foods. They detoxify harmful chemicals in the body called free radicals, which can cause long-term harm to cells. As such, triphala could theoretically prevent or delay aging-related diseases like heart disease and cancer.
                    <br>Proponents also claim that triphala, classified as Rasayana (meaning "path of essence") herbs, could support the health of people with: </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Obesity</li>
                    <li>High blood pressure</li>
                    <li>High cholestrol</li>
                    <li>Diabetes</li>
                </ul>
                <p>A 2012 Iranian study of 62 adults with obesity reported that a 12-week course of triphala was able to decrease:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Bodyweight</li>
                    <li>Body fat</li>
                    <li>Total cholestrol</li>
                    <li>Triglycerides</li>
                    <li>"Bad" LDL cholestrol</li>
                </ul>

                <h4>Guggul</h4>
                <p> Guggul is an Ayurvedic herb traditionally used to lower cholesterol. It is made from the oily sap of the guggul tree native to India, Bangladesh, and Pakistan. 
                    <br>
                    Historical records show that people have used guggul to treat cardiovascular disease since as far back as the 7th century. However, the research to date is mixed on whether the herb has this benefit.
                    <br>
                    A 2009 study from Norway reported that 18 people who took a 12-week course of guggul had slight improvements in cholesterol levels. Specifically, the guggul group had improved total cholesterol and "good" high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol compared to those provided a placebo. </p>

                <h4>Boswellia</h4>
                <p> Boswellia, also known as Indian frankincense, comes from the resin of the boswellia tree. The extract is rich in boswellic acid. Test tube studies have found that this compound may have anti-inflammatory effects.
                    <br>
                    Practitioners believe that these properties can support treatment of chronic inflammatory conditions, such as: </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Asthma</li>
                    <li>Cardiovascular disease</li>
                    <li>Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)</li>
                    <li>Ulcerative colitis (a form of inflammatory bowel disease, or IBD)</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    Scientists believe that a chemical known as acetyl-11-keto-β-boswellic acid can suppress specific inflammatory proteins. Some of these proteins are associated with chronic pain and swelling in people with osteoarthritis, or so-called "wear-and-tear arthritis".3
                    <br>
                    A 2011 study from India reported that a 30-day course of a purified form of boswellia, called Aflapin, reduced pain in 30 adults with knee arthritis. In addition, relief for many began as early as five days following the start of treatment.
                </p>

                <h4>Gotu Kola</h4>
                <p>Gotu kola, also known as Asiatic pennywort or Centella Asiatica, is a perennial plant in the Apiaceae family. Practitioners usually prescribe it as a tonic for mental and emotional support, including: </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Anxiety</li>
                    <li>Low mood</li>
                    <li>Mental fatigue</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Gotu kola acts as a mild stimulant. Though the evidence for it use remains mixed, proponents believe this herb can support the following: </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Memory loss</li>
                    <li>Depression</li>
                    <li>Alzhiemer's disease</li>
                    <li>Stroke</li>
                </ul>
                <p>A 2016 study from Indonesia reported that gotu kola improved memory in those who had experienced a stroke. Participants who took 750 to 1,000 milligrams (mg) of gotu kola for six weeks had more improved memory than those who took 3 mg of folic acid.</p>

                <!-- Herbal Medicines start -->
                <h2>Herbal Medicine</h2>
                <p>Products made from botanicals, or plants, that are used to treat diseases or to maintain health are called herbal products, botanical products, or phytomedicines. A product made from plants and used solely for internal use is called an herbal supplement.
                    <br>
                    Many prescription drugs and over-the-counter medicines are also made from plant products, but these products contain only purified ingredients and are regulated by the FDA. Herbal supplements may contain entire plants or plant parts.
                    <br>
                    Herbal supplements come in all forms: dried, chopped, powdered, capsule, or liquid, and can be used in various ways, including:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Swallowed as pills, powders, or tinctures</li>
                    <li>Brewed as tea</li>
                    <li>Applied to the skin as gels, lotions, or creams</li>
                    <li>Added to bath water</li>
                </ul>
